# FinSearch-Credit-Score-Algorithm
We will be creating a Neural Network model to predict a suitable Credit Score given various features of each borrower.
We have taken a dataset from Kaggle for the same. Out of the many features we will do feature selection followed by normalization and feed it to the model.
